# Examples

These are examples that I have used to understand the subject at hand, used in classes that I have taught, or both.

Examples may be excellent, but are as likely to be inane, superfluous, and wrong outside of demonstrating something about the language/framework.



## My interpretation of the license.

Officially all code is [MIT licensed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

With that said, I don't care how you use this code. I'd be flattered if this code helps someone, anyone besides me.
