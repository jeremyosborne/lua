Lab - Confetti Pigs from Space
------------------------------
The last example was preparation for this example. In the `example` folder is a lot of scaffolding for our Confetti Pigs from Space game. The game is a very simple version of missile command. The lab is designed to be a bit open and how exactly the lab will run depends on the class participant skill level and what the instructor feels is appropriate.
